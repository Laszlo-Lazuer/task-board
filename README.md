# task-board

Portfolio project focused on upskilling my backend knowledge to Sr. Backend Engineer level. This repository is a learning vehicle for building and iterating on a full-stack task board with production-grade backend practices.

## Goals
- Strengthen backend fundamentals (API design, data modeling, validation, error handling).
- Practice scalable architecture patterns and clean code boundaries.
- Improve performance, observability, testing, and documentation.
- Explore security and operational readiness (auth, config, environments, CI).

## Stack
- Backend: Java/Spring Boot
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript

## Notes
This project is intentionally iterative; features, structure, and conventions may evolve as I apply new backend concepts.
